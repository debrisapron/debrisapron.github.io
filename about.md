I'm a JavaScript / Ruby / Rails / whatever developer living between London and Los Angeles. I play music as THE EUROPEAN. I like programming, cooking, nature and pretending to be an elf with a bunch of grown adults.

If you might want to hire me for some reason here is my CV and my LinkedIn profile.
